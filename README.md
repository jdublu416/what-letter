# what-letter
This game application is created with javaScript and HTML5/CSS. It is a simple guessing game that allows the user 10 attempts to guess which letter the computer has randomly selected.  

The game structure is very simple and done with "vanilla" javaScript.  I chose to create this app to practice so very little design was considered. 

You can view the application [here](Take a peek [here](https://jdublu416.github.io/what-letter/).
